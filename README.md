## Styling
Require `components` and `containers` related stylesheets in your `.js` files like so:

```es6
require('../stylesheets/containers/App.scss')
require('../stylesheets/components/Button.scss')
```
Using this approach, you have to take care about the order in which you require styles.

Write your SCSS styles in the appropriate subfolders in `stylesheets/` directory.

### Base
The `base/` folder contains boilerplate stuff such as:
* `reset.scss` or `normalize.scss`
* `typography.scss`

### Components
The `components/` folder contains components-specific styles for smaller parts of your app such as:
* `Button.scss`
* `List.scss`
* `forms/ContactForm.scss`

### Containers
The `containers/` folder contains container-specific styles for major parts of your app such as:
* `App.scss`
* `Home.scss`
* `Contact.scss`

### Utils
The `utils/` folder contains global variables, mixins, functions, helper selectors and similar:
* `variables.scss` or `config.scss`
* `mixins.scss`
* `functions.scss`
* `placeholders.scss` or `helpers.scss`

### Vendors
The `vendors/` folder contains 3rd-party libraries and frameworks such as:
* `materialize.scss`
